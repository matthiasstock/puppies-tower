# Puppies Tower

A play tower suitable for 15 cm plush puppies.

This repository contains a rough documentation of a fun project. It consists of:

* a tower with a look-out
  * simple elevator
  * electronics with [source code](esp8266/tower.ino)

## Context

We already owned almost every plush puppy from a TV series, but the available play tower only fits with smaller figures. Therefore, I built a bigger version of it.

## Build Steps

:warning: This is no step by step guide and in the end, it was quite hard to build.

### Floor and Roof of the Look-Out

### Cut-Out Elements

### Applied Primer

## Lessons Learned

- The painting of PVC parts became an issue when using lacquers/acrylic paint suitable for children
  - Make some tests first
  - Check the instructions of the paint cans for their minimal processing temperature
- I only had white wire at hand, which got complicated
  - Use multiple colors
  - Mark the wires
- Get a long USB cable to upload code to the already installed NodeMCU
